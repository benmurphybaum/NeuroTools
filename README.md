# NeuroTools

For the most updated version, and access to newly available analysis packages, download from www.benmurphybaum.com/NeuroToolsStore

NeuroTools is an Igor-based toolbox for data organization and executing batch analysis routines. NeuroTools offers an intuitive user interface with powerful tools for building and saving data sets, which can then be used as organized wave lists for repeated analysis routines. Custom functions that interface with NeuroTools are simple to write, and give the user unmatched flexibility for custom analysis. NeuroTools intelligently analyzes your code so the input parameters from your functions are neatly displayed as control inputs within the GUI.

ANeuroTools was originally written with electrophysiological and functional imaging data in mind, but is now developed as a fairly general purpose analysis suite. While NeuroTools provides a suite of built in basic functions, users can easily import their own functions into NeuroTools by placing the .ipf in the :Functions folder within the NeuroTools file structure, allowing them to use Data Sets with their own functions. Many of the data organization concepts in NeuroTools were inspired by previous work by Dr. W. Rowland Taylor and Dr. Rob Smith.
