NeuroTools provides an interface for efficiently navigating, organizing, and performing analysis routines on large data sets in the Igor Pro environment. 

At its core, NeuroTools is an alternative data browser that allows users to define, save, and recall 'Data Sets' using powerful wave matching tools. 'Data Sets' are filtered lists of wave paths that can be recalled at will for arbitrary analysis routines. Data Sets can be organized and divided in various ways, so as to run batches of waves through a function separately. NeuroTools was originally written with electrophysiological and functional imaging data in mind, but is now developed as a fairly general purpose analysis suite. 

While NeuroTools provides a suite of built in basic functions, an 'External Functions' module allows the user to easily import their own functions into AT, allowing them to use Data Sets with their own functions. Many of the data organization concepts in NeuroTools were inspired by previous work by Dr. W. Rowland Taylor and Dr. Rob Smith.

TO INSTALL:
NeuroTools requires the HDF5 package to be installed in Igor. This is included natively in Igor, and Igor has help instructions on how to do this.

Put the .ipf files in the 'User Procedures' folder, and put the NT_Loader.ipf in the 'Igor Procedures' folder. To open NeuroTools, navigate to the 'Analysis:Packages' menu, and select Load_NeuroTools. 

*To access availableÂ functions, click the vertical bar in the center of the GUI to collapse and expand the Parameters panel.
